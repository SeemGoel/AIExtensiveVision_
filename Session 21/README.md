### Assignment 21 
## Custom GPT-2 Text Generation with Hugging Face Integration
This repository provides the tools and resources for training and using a custom text generation model based on the GPT-2 architecture. It draws inspiration from Andrey Karpathy's video walkthrough of GPT-2 code.

## Project Goal:

The primary aim of this project is to empower users to create and utilize a customized version of the GPT-2 model for text generation tasks. This involves training the model on a user-defined dataset and fine-tuning it for specific needs.

#### Key Features:

- Customizable GPT-2 Model: Implement the GPT-2 architecture from scratch or leverage existing implementations with tailored modifications.
- Comprehensive Training: Access instructions and scripts to train the model effectively on your chosen dataset.
- Streamlined Inference: Utilize the trained model for text generation with readily available code.
- Evaluation Techniques: Employ metrics and methods to assess the quality of the generated text.
- Detailed Documentation: Benefit from clear explanations and resources related to GPT-2 and its custom implementation.
- Hugging Face Integration: Seamlessly integrate with the Hugging Face Transformers library for access to pre-trained models and further customization options.
